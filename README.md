# Hang man with a Beach Theme

This is our third homework project for the Coding Boot Camp.

This project is useful for us to comprehend and understand how the HTML, CSS, but most of all JavaScript all work together. It is important to understand how all the skills and knowledge we've been given in the past few weeks can work together to create a complex design. By knowing simple pieces we are given an opportunity to grow and teach ourselves more complex codes and fix bugs when we encounter them in our own code or with the help of others.

To get started with this game:
                Click any letter to begin guessing
                Choose your letters wisely to guess the correct word for things you find at the beach.
                You will be alerted when you win or lose.
